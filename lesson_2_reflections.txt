What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do this?
When you initialize a repository it create a .git hidden file to store commits. You need to do it to create the repository and it can save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
I imagine it as off to the side. Almost like a work bench that I would set up tools and whatnot before starting a project. It allows me to see what is about the be commited.
