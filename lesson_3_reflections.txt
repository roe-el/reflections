When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When others will be pulling files, or when you want to make changes on a computer other than your own.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want your version to stay the same, or manipulate it yourself.
