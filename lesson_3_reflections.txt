When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When others will be pulling files, or when you want to make changes on a computer other than your own.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want your version to stay the same, or manipulate it yourself.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork create repos on your GitHub profile that you can push onto.
Clones are copies of repos that you acquire from GitHub profiles.
Branches are in repos that are versions of the master branch.
You would use fork to create a repo and clone it to you local machine to make changes. Branches are for prototyping code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is if you are working offline you can access the lastest changes that had been made before you lost a connection.
